Part 2 is a single question that must be implemented in Java. 

The problem provides an interface for a VendingMachine. Your job is to create a class that implements
the interface and behaves the way that the test suite in `Question6Test.java` expects.

# Getting Started

You will need to have Maven installed. It is the compile and test system for this problem. 

If you are on MacOS and have homebrew installed, you can install Maven with `brew install maven`. Otherwise, it 
is available from the website: https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html

To run the test suite, from this directory, you can do:
```
mvn test
```

The main code for the question is under `src/main/` and the test suite is under `src/test`.
