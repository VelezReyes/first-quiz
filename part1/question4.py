# Instructions:
# Question 4 and Question 5 are about writing SQL. THey use the database that is 
# created in the file `pets_db.py`. 
# These questions use a database called SQLite. You do not need to install anything.
# In the file `pets_db.py` three tables are created. Data is then added to each 
# of the tables. The questions below are about how the data in each of the tables
# is related.

# Part 4.A:
# Write SQL to select the pets that are owned by nobody.
# The output should be a list of tuples in the format: (<pet name>, <species>, <age>)

sql_pets_owned_by_nobody = """
SELECT a.name, a.species, a.age
FROM animals a
LEFT JOIN people_animals pa ON a.animal_id = pa.pet_id
WHERE pa.owner_id IS NULL;
"""

# Part 4.B:
# Write SQL to select how the number of pets are older than their owners. 
# The output should be an integer.

sql_pets_older_than_owner = """

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM animals a
JOIN people_animals pa ON a.animal_id = pa.pet_id
JOIN people p ON pa.owner_id = p.person_id
WHERE a.age > p.age;

"""

# Part 4.C: BONUS CHALLENGE! 
# Write SQL to select the pets that are owned by Bessie and nobody else.
# The output should be a list of tuples in the format: (<person name>, <pet name>, <species>)
sql_only_owned_by_bessie = """ 

SELECT p.name, a.name, a.species
