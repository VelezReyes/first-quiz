### (Part 1 and 2 updated with solutions from the community!)

# primera etapa

¡Bienvenid@s a la primera prueba del programa VélezReyes+ Tech Fellows 2024! We are so excited that you are here and to embark on this journey together.

As you can see, this journey will also be in _English_ and we hope that this process is also a great resource for you to practice your English and see it in action in technical contexts. If you are not entirely comfortable in English, we encourage you to use translation software, friends, anything! Please keep in mind that here at ver+ we value resourcefulness, a learning mindset, attention to detail, and care for each other above all else! 

### Instructions

There are three parts to this challenge, each in their own folder: each part contains its own questions. Each part has its own README with some light instructions on what is expected of each question. As you will see, most of the questions involve editing the question file in place, and in certain circumstances, a test harness is provided.

**TO START**

_FORK_ the repository to commence the test. If you do not fork the repository, your participation will not be counted. Please DO NOT CLONE the repository, and make sure you fork it.

**TO SUBMIT**

There is a multi-step submit process. **DO NOT OPEN A PULL REQUEST**. THIS MIGHT DISQUALIFY YOU AUTOMATICALLY. Please make sure you follow these instructions as we will not accept any other submission method!
1. When your solution is ready, create a git diff patch and compress it. You can do so with the following command _from your working branch_: `git diff main > first_quiz_submission.patch && zip first_quiz_submission.zip first_quiz_submission.patch`.
2. Your submission must be with this filename-- we will not accept any submissions that do not match the file pattern.
3. Upload your patch, binaries, and other required information in this [form](https://forms.gle/UYnRpDorzThZmdhD7)! You can go back and update your answers as much as you want before the deadline.

DO NOT OPEN A PULL REQUEST-- this will disqualify you. We will NOT accept pull requests or branches-- please make sure you use the diff generation method to generate your patch.

### The deadline is Sunday, November 5th at 3:00pm Colombia.
We will judge the timeliness of submissions by the timestamp of your form submission. You will be notified of your results on November 8th.

```We wish you the best for this week!```

Remember that our team is here for you, and truly excited that each and everyone of you are here with the ambition and passion to transform both your lives and the lives of others through technology.

*What if I can't install the requirements on my localhost?*

We highly recommend that you find a way to complete this challenge locally. We have designed this to require minimal packages, and if you have access to a Linux terminal, you should be able to edit and run all the code. If you absolutely cannot do so at this stage, you can also use most online REPLs such as Github Dev or REPL.it which should support the packages needed. Please keep in mind that the second stage requires a proper localhost environment setup for full stack development.

If you don't have a native Linux terminal, and for example, are with a Windows machine, you can also find workarounds that allow you to get the code up and running! We encourage you to use the internet to find the equivalent commands to run the code. Remember, too, that we have provided _convenience_ configuration commands, but they are not entirely necessary to complete the test.

*What if I don't understand certain instructions?*

Part of the test is seeing an existing code base and being able to navigate the documentation and files no matter what. We encourage you to use Google, translators, and to play around with the code until it makes more sense how to proceed. The ver+ team will unfortunately NOT be providing clarifications to the instructions.

*Can I make edits to any file? Including the test files?*

Great question! It is up to you to edit and decide what is necessary to make a complete submission. We value attention to detail so please feel free to make necessary edits when you find them!

*What if I discover a bug with the code?*

If you believe you've discovered a true error that would prevent anyone from completing the test, please message Karen Sun in the Slack channel. You should have received a link to the Slack channel if you are eligible for this stage of the test!

*I found this repository. Can I make a submission?*

While you are free to use this repository to practice your engineering skills, only those who have been identified as eligible for this program and have been invited to our Slack program channel are eligible for the ver+ tech fellowship in 2024.

*What if I don't have a Gmail account?*

You will need a gmail account in order to use our submission form. Please make a free account (which will surely be useful in the future as well!) in order to enter your submission.


_If there are questions not addressed here about the class, please put your questions into the `#etapa1-test` channel in Slack_
